A **REST API** for managing restaurant-related tasks.  
This project is **a work in progress**, and features will be added progressively.

The goal is to document my learning journey in building **Spring RESTful APIs** following the [Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html).

> If you're a **frontend developer** looking for an API to integrate withâ€”whether to showcase your skills or learn alongside meâ€”feel free to use this API.

## **Features**

### âœ… Currently Implemented
- CRUD operations for:
    - **Restaurants & Kitchens**
    - **States & Cities**

### ðŸš§ Upcoming Features
- Global exception handler with standardized request/response formats
- Authentication (Spring Security, JWT, OAuth2)
- Product, Order, Product Photo, Groups, Users, Permissions
- Deployment for public access

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Java** 17+
- **Spring Boot** (Web, Validation, Data JPA)
- **MySQL** 8+ (local instance)
- Build Tool: **Maven**

---

## **Architecture**

The API is designed with **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** principles, organized into layers:

### **Aggregates**
- **Restaurant**:
    - Owns an **Address**
    - Relates to a **Kitchen**
    - Supports multiple **Payment Methods**
    - Contains **Products** and **Responsible Users**
- **Product**: Has a **ProductPhoto** (filename, description, content type, size)
- **Order**: Linked to a **Restaurant**, **User** (customer), and **Payment Method**; contains **Order Items**
- **User â†” Group â†” Permission**: Many-to-many relationship for RBAC
- **City**: Belongs to a **State**

### **Layered Structure**
- `api/` â†’ Controllers, DTOs, Request/Response Models
- `domain/` â†’ Entities, Value Objects, Services, Exceptions
- `infra/` â†’ Repositories, Configuration, Storage Adapters

## **Getting Started**

### **1) Database Configuration (MySQL â€“ localhost)**
Ensure MySQL is installed and a database is created.  
Add your configuration to `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.application.name=dbname
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbname?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>

spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

> **Note:** Hibernate will automatically create the tables on first run.

---

### **2) Run the Application**
Using Maven wrapper:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
